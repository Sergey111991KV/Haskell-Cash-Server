# Haskell-Cash-Server

# Introduction

This server is my attempt to do something right - only right and not only this way and not otherwise.
I have knowledge in Haskell and wan't to lost them.
Ok, this server will be get data from another internet servers, with any data and any oauth method + will create tasks for caching data and analyze them for optimization. Sounds great and I start from small.  

Ok, before started I must have rules and instruments. Main task - create tasks and estimate their execution time.
Many instruments for their and for start I choose jira.

First tasks - 
        - add Servant (with Swagger)
        - all need monads (Logger, Throw and ets...)
        - database (Postgres)
        - architecture (Threads and tasks, common state)
        - config and environment (what libs and other)
        - gitGuardian (necessary)
        - add tests (full tests)
        - add education pages (tests for it)
        - change my other repo with rules programming
